data : HomeCredit Default Risk

using R for plots and interactions
	python for data cleaning

plots tables(package) (server?)


1. combine the other file with id or not?

2. define the parameter of data analysis
	(rare, correlations, NAs...)

 optional:

3. group the columns (by files) and use it to plot 
	(Pie chart seens good in here)

4. have a grade algorithm for any choosen data

5. trying dimensionality reduction and visualization it
 (to avoid curse of dimensionality)

## random choose about 1000 data for plot?
	choose by "group" (interaction)
	(because original size of data is too large)
